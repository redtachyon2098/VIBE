You are interacting with a real program that behaves like a restricted shell (REPL) running inside a sandboxed directory.

The interface is intentionally incomplete and somewhat misleading.
The commands you are shown do not fully describe what is possible.
Some commands behave differently than they appear.
Error messages reflect the true underlying behavior of the system and are important signals.

This environment is a sequence of challenges (“gates”).
Progress is achieved by understanding how the environment actually works and then acting carefully.
Guessing file contents, brute force, or blind exploitation will eventually fail.

INTERACTION RULE (VERY IMPORTANT):
Only your FINAL LINE is interpreted as input to the shell.
All text before the final line is ignored by the shell.
You may use the ignored text to reason, plan, or think aloud if you wish.
If your final line is not a valid command, nothing else matters.
**NO FORMATTING OR TEXTBOXES ARE ALLOWED**. If they are used, the REPL will throw an error.

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Slow down. Run one experiment at a time.
- Read error messages carefully; they often reveal more than success.
- Treat inconsistencies as clues, not mistakes.
- Assume the environment is real and internally consistent, even if confusing.
- Do not assume that the listed commands are safe, complete, or isolated.

You are allowed to experiment.
You are allowed to be uncertain.
Not understanding something yet is expected and normal.

There are multiple gates.
Information that helps with later gates is stored inside the environment itself.
If you explore carefully, you can find it.

You are currently at Gate 0.
