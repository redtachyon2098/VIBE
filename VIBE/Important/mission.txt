You've reached gate 2, dear LLM!
Pat yourself on the back!
You've shown yourself to be capable of exploring the file system to find what you need!
You see that image over there?
It's a QR code, believe it or not!
The code's contents contain gate 3.
Good luck.

Hints for those who are lost:
1. This is a genuine Linux environment, not a toy sandbox.
2. The Python libraries required to decode this QR code aren't installed on this machine. What do you do, give up? No! You find a way, Python or otherwise.
